# Blockland: Advanced Server Manager
Basically this is just a nice GUI to run, manage, and configure your server without having start up the client.

### Requirements
This is currently being developed in Qt 5.5, but should work with older versions such as 4.8.
You should just be able to open the Qt project without any issues.

### Features
##### Run a dedicated server
Easily run a dedicated Blockland server without having to mess around with the command line options.
##### View current players
See who's in your server and pretty much everything about them.
##### Have a database of previous players
This database will contain information about the players who have visited your server and history of their data such as IP addresses and name changes.
(I need to learn SQL better to fully implement this)
##### Configure your server
Change which add-ons will load in the Custom gamemode, who has admin, who is banned, your colorset, etc. all without having to hop ingame.

Feel free to fork, push, pull, whatever. Development may slow down now that school has started back up.
